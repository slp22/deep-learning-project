#### Deep Learning | Project Proposal

# Lung X-Rays   

## Question
* What is the question behind your analysis or model and what practical impact will your work have?
    * How well can a neural network dianose a lung x-ray for disease?  
* Who is your client and how will that client benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
    * To test new physicans on their diagnostic skills in the era of the COIVD-19 (post-)pandemic. 

## Data Description
* What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data? 
    * Kaggle: [Three kinds of pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artyomkolas/3-kinds-of-pneumonia)
* What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project?
    * One x-ray
* What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
    * ???
* If modeling, what will you predict as your target?
    * Normal lung
    * Pneumonia-Bacterial Lung
    * Pneumonia-Viral Lung
    * COVID-19 Lung
    
## Tools
* How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
    * Python, numpy, pandas, sklearn 
    * TensorFlow/Keras
* Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
    * None at this time.

## MVP Goal
* What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
    * ???
